# 100. Understanding Leads to Freedom

>A life of constraint and suppression is not <span style=font-style:normal>yoga</a>. The mind must be free of desires and relaxed. It 
comes with understanding, not with determination, which is but another form of memory. An 
understanding mind is free of desires and fears.</p>

<p><b>Questioner:</b> In many countries of the world, investigating officers follow certain practices aimed at 
extracting confessions from their victim and also changing his personality if needed. By a judicious 
choice of physical and moral deprivations and by persuasions, the old personality is broken down 
and a new personality established in its place. The man under investigation hears repeated so many times 
that he is an enemy of the State and a traitor to his country, that a day comes when 
something in him breaks down and he begins to feel with full conviction that he is a traitor, a rebel, 
altogether despicable and deserving of the direst punishment. This process is known as brain-washing.

It struck me that the religious and <a href="One who practices <em>yoga</em>.">yogi</a>c practices are very similar to brain-washing. There is the same 
physical and mental deprivation, solitary confinement, a powerful sense of sin, despair, and a desire 
to escape through expiation and conversion, adoption of a new image of oneself and impersonating 
that image. There is also the same repetition of set formula: “God is good; the <a href="Spiritual teacher, preceptor.">guru</a> (party) knows; faith will 
save me”. In the so-called *yogi*c or religious practices the same mechanism operates. The mind is 
made to concentrate on some particular idea to the exclusion of all other ideas and concentration is 
powerfully reïnforced by rigid discipline and painful austerities. A high price in life and happiness is 
paid and what one gets in return appears therefore to be of great importance. This preärranged 
conversion, obvious or hidden, religious or political, ethical or social, may look genuine and lasting, 
yet there is a feeling of artificiality about it.</p>

<p><b>Maharaj:</b> You are quite right. By undergoing so many hardships the mind gets dislocated and 
immobilised. Its condition becomes precarious; whatever it undertakes results in a deeper bondage.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Then why are <a href="The practice which produces success, <em>siddhi</em>.">sadhana</a>s prescribed?</p>

<p><b>M:</b> Unless you make tremendous efforts, you will not be convinced that effort will take you 
nowhere. The self is so self-confident, that unless it is totally discouraged, it will not give up. Mere 
verbal conviction is not enough. Hard facts alone can show the absolute nothingness of the self-image.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> The brain-washer drives me mad, and the <i>guru</i> drives me sane. The driving is similar. Yet the 
motive and the purpose are totally different. The similarities are perhaps merely verbal.</p>

<p><b>M:</b> Inviting or compelling to suffer contains violence and the fruit of violence cannot be sweet.

There are certain life situations that are inevitably painful, and you have to take them in your stride. There 
are also certain situations which you have created either deliberately or by neglect. And from these 
you must learn a lesson so that they are not repeated.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> It seems that we must suffer, so that we learn to overcome pain.</p>

<p><b>M:</b> Pain has to be endured. There is no such thing as overcoming the pain and no training is 
needed. Training for the future and developing attitudes is a sign of fear.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Once I know how to face pain, I am free of it, not afraid of it, and therefore happy. This is what 
happens to a prisoner. He accepts his punishment as just and proper and is at peace with the 
prison authorities and the State. All religions do nothing else but preach acceptance and surrender. 
We are being encouraged to plead guilty, to feel responsible for all the evils in the world and point at 
ourselves as their only cause. My problem is that I cannot see much difference between brain-washing 
and <i>sadhana</i>, except that in the case of <i>sadhana</i> one is not physically constrained. The element of 
compulsive suggestion is present in both.</p>

<p><b>M:</b> As you have said, the similarities are superficial. You need not harp on them.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Sir, the similarities are not superficial. Man is a complex being and can be at the same time the 
accuser and the accused, the judge, the warden and the executioner. There is not much that is 
voluntary in a ‘voluntary’ <i>sadhana</i>. One is moved by forces beyond one’s knowledge and control. I can 
change my mental metabolism as little as the physical, except by painful and protracted efforts — 
which is <i>yoga</i>. All I am asking is, does Maharaj agree with me that <i>yoga</i> implies violence?</p>

<p><b>M:</b> I agree that <i>yoga</i>, as presented by you, means violence and I never advocate any form of 
violence. My path is totally nonviolent. I mean exactly what I say: nonviolent. Find out for yourself 
what it is. I merely say: it is nonviolent.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> I am not misusing words. When a <i>guru</i> asks me to meditate sixteen hours a day for the rest of 
my life, I cannot do it without extreme violence to myself. Is such a <i>guru</i> right or wrong?</p>

<p><b>M:</b> None compels you to meditate sixteen hours a day unless you feel like doing so. It is only a 
way of telling you, “remain with yourself, don’t get lost among others”. The teacher will wait, but the
mind is impatient.

It is not the teacher — it is the mind that is violent and also afraid of its own violence. What is of the 
mind is relative; it is a mistake to make it into an absolute.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> If I remain passive, nothing will change. If I am active, I must be violent. What is it I can do 
which is neither sterile nor violent?</p>

<p><b>M:</b> Of course, there is a way which is neither violent nor sterile and yet supremely effective. Just 
look at yourself as you are, see yourself as you are, accept yourself as you are and go ever deeper 
into what you are. Violence and nonviolence describe your attitude to others; the self in relation to 
itself is neither violent nor nonviolent, it is either aware or unaware of itself. If it knows itself, all it 
does will be right; if it does not, all it does will be wrong.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What do you mean by saying, “I know myself as I am”?</p>

<p><b>M:</b> Before the mind — I am. “I am” is not a thought in the mind — the mind happens to me, I do not 
happen to the mind. And since time and space are in the mind, I am beyond time and space, eternal 
and omnipresent.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Are you serious? Do you really mean that you exist everywhere and at all times?</p>

<p><b>M:</b> Yes, I do. To me it is as obvious as the freedom of movement is to you. Imagine a tree asking a 
monkey, “Do you seriously mean that you can move from place to place?”. And the monkey saying, 
“Yes. I do”.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Are you also free from causality? Can you produce miracles?</p>

<p><b>M:</b> The world itself is a miracle. I am beyond miracles — I am absolutely normal. With me 
everything happens as it must. I do not interfere with creation. Of what use are small miracles to me 
when the greatest of miracles is happening all the time? Whatever you see, it is always your own 
being that you see. Go ever deeper into yourself, seek within; there is neither violence nor nonviolence 
in self-discovery. The destruction of the false is not violence.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> When I practice self-inquiry or go within with the idea that it will profit me in some way or 
other, I am still escaping from what I am.</p>

<p><b>M:</b> Quite right. True inquiry is always into something, not out of something. When I enquire how to 
get or avoid something, I am not really enquiring. To know anything I must accept it totally.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Yes, to know God I must accept God — how frightening!</p>

<p><b>M:</b> Before you can accept God, you must accept yourself, which is even more frightening. The first 
steps in self acceptance are not at all pleasant, for what one sees is not a happy sight. One needs 
all the courage to go further. What helps is silence. Look at yourself in total silence; do not describe 
yourself. Look at the being you believe you are and remember — you are not what you see. “This I 
am not — what am I?” is the movement of self-enquiry. There are no other means to liberation; all 
else means delay. Resolutely reject what you are not until the real Self emerges in its glorious 
nothingness, its ‘not-a-thingness.’</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> The world is passing through rapid and critical changes. We can see them with great clarity in 
the United States, though they happen in other countries. There is an increase in crime on one 
hand and more genuine holiness on the other. Communities are being formed and some of them 
are on a very high level of integrity and austerity. It looks as if evil is destroying itself by its own 
successes like a fire which consumes its fuel, while the good, like life, perpetuates itself.</p>

<p><b>M:</b> As long as you divide events into good and evil, you may be right. In fact, good becomes evil 
and evil becomes good by their own fulfilment.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What about love?</p>

<p><b>M:</b> When it turns to lust, it becomes destructive.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What is lust?</p>

<p><b>M:</b> Remembering, imagining, anticipating. It is sensory and verbal. A form of addiction.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Is <a href="Continence, self-restraint from sexual activity, celibacy. <em>Brahmacharya</em> in its wider sense stands not only for abstinence from sexual indulgence, but also for freedom from craving for all sensual pleasures.">brahmacharya</a>, continence, imperative in <i>yoga</i>?</p>

<p><b>M:</b> A life of constraint and suppression is not <i>yoga</i>. The mind must be free of desires and relaxed. It 
comes with understanding, not with determination, which is but another form of memory. An 
understanding mind is free of desires and fears.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> How can I make myself understand?</p>

<p><b>M:</b> By meditating, which means giving attention. Become fully aware of your problem, look at it from 
all sides, watch how it affects your life. Then leave it alone. You can’t do more than that.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Will it set me free?</p>

<p><b>M:</b> You are free from what you have understood. The outer expressions of freedom may take time 
to appear, but they are already there. Do not expect perfection. There is no perfection in 
manifestation. Details must clash. No problem is solved completely, but you can withdraw from it to 
a level on which it does not operate.
